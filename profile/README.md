At its core, traditional IT Operations is overwhelmingly reactive - humans respond to incidents and tickets. There is so much noise! Alerts, tickets, audits, chat threads and more. What if ops could catch the small things before they turn into big problems? What if your ops team built tools that allowed them to be proactive?

You can find code here which helps your team adopt Proactive Ops practices. For every project released here, we have an associated post. You can [read our previous posts in the Proactive Ops archive](https://www.proactiveops.io/archive).
